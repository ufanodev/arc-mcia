# How to Document and Which Tools To Use

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There are many strategies or mechanisms for documenting architecture and knowledge, and we need a standard on how to do it.

## Decision

Document architectures using ADRs and templates on Confluence.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Versioning applied to all document


### Negative
- Several ADRs and perhaps potentially more information to be consumed/read.
